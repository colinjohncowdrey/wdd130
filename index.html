            <p>I was born in England and immigrated to Australia with my parents when I was 6 years old. My parents joined the church when I was two years old and we were sealed in the London temple. I graduated from the Elizabeth Boys Technical High School. I served a mission in the New Zealand Christchurch Mission. I am married and have five children, all boys. Each of them have served a mission. After my mission I studied a Bachelor of Arts degree in Accounting. I received by degree and became a Certified Public Accountant. I have worked both Private and Government organisations. I retired in 2024 and am now serving as a full time senior missionary working in the Learning Centre in Lae in Papua New Guinea.</p>
